How was your month of September? This time, I'm releasing one simfile for the month!

This chart and song encapsulates being aware of the world around you, and how, perhaps your decisions
were part of the effects that made it the imperfect world that it is. The flipside to that is,
it's a fun song! That stream of banjo makes it feel like a wild cowboy ride, which heroically lead me to 
make a chart for it. 

Also, next month will be time for FearMIX, so I'm anticipating the spooks that will bring.
