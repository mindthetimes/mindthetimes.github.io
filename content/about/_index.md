I’m Jenro. I’m a casual gamer who’s also a stepartist. This site is a springboard for my ideals and the things that I experience to be fun, from my primary interests, to my hobbies, and my skills. Recently I've been into life simulation games, roguelike games, and I've always been into strategy games. Rhythm games are quite the trip, and I mention some of my efforts to create stepcharts below.

Just a quick notice that this site is currently work-in-progress. I hope you still find this site useful despite its initial stages.

## Life simulation games

I might upload Sims 4 builds here, and other games involving life. Talking about the genre itself is a bit wonky but there's a lot I would like to explore with these types of games, especially the creative aspects of it (the building and the characters)!

## Roguelike games

Calling each play session as “runs” for roguelike games gives me chills sometimes. What are they running from, and where are they running to?! It’s the nature of these games that pique my interest, and I think fortune favors the bold that way!

## Strategy games

Yep. That’s where it’s at! Gamers are just on that cruise by no means.

## Rhythm games

I’d like to think that these games help keep our alert levels in check. And by making my own stepcharts, I alert my audience to what they might get into. Paving a path towards direction means something, huh?

I started making stepcharts back in 2007 but never got to upload those online. I resumed making them in 2014, and a small set of files were first released. At the end of 2019, I continued making stepcharts but with the start of the global pandemic, it felt unclear how my audience would take the releases. Quite a bit of worry, but not knowing is part of what makes it fun.

## Pointing towards fun

Obliging or luring people to have fun isn’t the outset one would hope for beginnings to be. These beginnings vary, and traversing both retrospect and modern progress is making games more and more into an investment journey. And it has made kids change. 

Knowing all this, can fun still be truly attained? I sure think so!
