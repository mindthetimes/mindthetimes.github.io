Dearest of days it is, this one that has passed before us, January 27, of the year 2023. That's quite the conjecture, I suppose, but it is an important one from my side of the world. I have brought a brew of frappuccino for myself and a mango drink to my older sister. This is a very tasty brew, with its price a bit on the affordable side. I have also come across a copy of “Diarios de Motocicleta” on the internet and watched the movie with my mother tonight.

I have appreciated the value of this movie. 'Tis a tale of two young chaps, a biochemist by the name of Alberto, and the one called Ernesto, bright in his pursuits of medicine. My mother was not privy to her wits about the movie and let out a few good laughs. I, on the other hand, soaked myself into the film quite so, driven by the role of Ernesto as both their travels unfold. Our leads are both full of ideas and enthusiasm and light for the world, it was great to cherish seeing the actors’ smiles and how their desire for travel, at times whimsical it was, lit up their lives and where they saw their place in South America.

There is more to see with the movie being quite the experience that I, too, quite long for. From the established community they live in, within Argentina, to the wide terrains in Chile, and then to where they’re headed to volunteer in Peru. Saying it in words is quite an understatement, and that's why I have a longing for the same journey. There's an anxiety that exists saying that it's already a time that has passed me by, or it's a situation only for the youths of this age. Where I am from, which is the Philippines, things may be quite the push and pull and you can often feel that you're not allowed to enjoy the journey, or even to create a journey of your own. Well, a lot of those journey's are in each individual's private lives. The influence of this part of history (yeah, I might not have told that this movie is based on a true story) has reached our part of the world and let's say that...it is quite causing a stir on the modern times. Is it worth nothing, even?

On to the sum of the movie, and how it's making me feel at the moment - it leaves you with an impression and it is something I can take with me as a designer, and as a traveler of my own in this journey of life. It is not something to be taken lightly, as it is a part of what is now historical, but I am trying to dig deep into how it makes me as my own being. Through Ernesto's eyes, I know and see this injustice, and I have some things from within that are able to make this known for myself. And though Alberto is unabashed in saying his "ijo del putas" to Ernesto, it took a lot from him being part of that same journey. Truly, there were a lot of curse words in that film.

With that, you already know that their partnership holds a balance. And I would understand and come to terms as to how that balance is.
