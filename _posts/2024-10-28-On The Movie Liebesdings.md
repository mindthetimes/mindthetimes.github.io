The nuances of writing elude me further, my mind often left blank. As my eyes pass through a movie, not one with seemingly much depth to it, I can't help but resign to the fate of my condition - that I am mentally disabled and have the lack of capacity to divulge right into the details when it need be.

The aforementioned movie is Liebesdings (Love Thing, 2022), a tale about an actor Marvin. I have watched hundreds of movies, and I know that actors have to be a shell to their character, and that is what he is portraying - a lead and a driver to the story. Now, in this story, Marvin is a successful actor with a popularity that's off the charts. But some antagonist figure wants to get into a hot topic and dig deeper to secrets Marvin may be hiding. I'm not sure if this is what you call 'defamation', putting someone in a bad light. But yes, Marvin falls prey to it and gives a bad interview, and is forced to go in hiding at a small theater he stumbled upon. This theater does comedy improv and has mascots dressed up in different sexual organs and objects.

From there, the story doesn't quite progress well. If we go by clichés, I was expecting Marvin's character to develop while staying in the theater, but instead he just gets stressed over the press material about him. It definitely showed how it's difficult to start over, or just shift into something new, when you're...guilty of something. Or just, a lot of it, really.

The movie kind of rushes itself to tie up the loose ends, which were from scenarios that were not properly given its time, yet somehow oddly felt necessary or just kept that way due to the flow or just going by clichés and for the sake of the lead character, Marvin. We know he's famous, but then the rest of the wimpy and cringy side of him just sort of follows suit after, and somehow by the end someone catches his fall.

This movie is giving me a lot to think about, but also it tackles things that I've realized I have been ignoring, which Marvin's character was able to bring into the foray of my attention. This includes the LGBTQIA+ friendly characters found in the theater and what they were standing up for, and what exactly makes them marginalized. Something about pursuing this conversation stresses me out, and it's not just some phobia or experience that Marvin and his pals had. It was their place in the story, as if it was an afterthought, or something thoroughly random, that it could be accused as a plot written by a chatbot/artificial intelligence.

It was difficult to write this as I, myself, struggle with the veracity and weight of my own words, much like Marvin questioning his own fame and success, even relating that to a past experience of mine.

That being said, it was a solid movie.
