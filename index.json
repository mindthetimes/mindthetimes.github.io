I’m a casual gamer who’s also a stepartist. This site is a springboard for my ideals and the things that I experience to be fun, from my primary interests, to my hobbies, and my skills. Recently I\u0026rsquo;ve been into life simulation games, roguelike games, and I\u0026rsquo;ve always been into strategy games. Rhythm games are quite the trip, and I mention some of my efforts to create stepcharts below.\nJust a quick notice that this site is currently work-in-progress. I hope you still find this site useful despite its initial stages. Life simulation games #I might upload Sims 4 builds here, and other games involving life. Talking about the genre itself is a bit wonky but there\u0026rsquo;s a lot I would like to explore with these types of games, especially the creative aspects of it (the building and the characters)!\nRoguelike games #Calling each play session as “runs” for roguelike games gives me chills sometimes. What are they running from, and where are they running to?! It’s the nature of these games that pique my interest, and I think fortune favors the bold that way!\nStrategy games #Yep. That’s where it’s at! Gamers are just on that cruise by no means.\nRhythm games #I’d like to think that these games help keep our alert levels in check. And by making my own stepcharts, I alert my audience to what they might get into. Paving a path towards direction means something, huh?\nI started making stepcharts back in 2007 but never got to upload those online. I resumed making them in 2014, and a small set of files were first released. At the end of 2019, I continued making stepcharts but with the start of the global pandemic, it felt unclear how my audience would take the releases. Quite a bit of worry, but not knowing is part of what makes it fun.\nPointing towards fun #Obliging or luring people to have fun isn’t the outset one would hope for beginnings to be. These beginnings vary, and traversing both retrospect and modern progress is making games more and more into an investment journey. And it has made kids change.\nKnowing all this, can fun still be truly attained? I sure think so!\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://jenro.fun/about/","section":"About","summary":"","title":"About"},{"content":" Find out how to install and play DDR game engines for the PC in this article. If you’re like me and have been playing Dance Dance Revolution since you were 8 years old, you might be wondering how to play the game in your own home and might even want to set up your own arcade system. Whether it’s for nostalgia’s sake or you want to professionally get in on streaming sites like Twitch, there are multiple options for rhythm PC gaming in 2025, specifically Dance Dance Revolution in 2025.\nDisclaimer! I’m a bit of a casual rhythm gamer myself, so take this information lightly. You can find the update date for this article above. Before I introduce you to some of these software options, we must begin with StepMania, which started as the first dance rhythm game engine for the PC back in 2001.\nWhat is StepMania? #StepMania is a free dance and rhythm game for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The project currently lives on at their website and has their own Github releases page.\nI started with using Stepmania 3.9 for its light capacity, and a standalone non-install version of that is on archive.org as StepMania 3.9+ ReduxFull. A good idea to start with if you don’t want the software to do a lot of heavy lifting at first.\nProject Outfox # More information on this game engine will be added on a later date. ITGMania # More information on this game engine will be added on a later date. With that being said, which game engine you choose for playing Dance Dance Revolution on PC varies, and although statistically speaking the data on these downloads aren’t readily available, articles such as these and other content and what is being endorsed can help you start that arcade journey again, this time with a more perceptive online audience.\n","date":"November 19, 2025","permalink":"https://jenro.fun/posts/how-to-play-dance-dance-revolution-on-pc-in-2025/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"How To Play Dance Dance Revolution on PC in 2025"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://jenro.fun/topics/rhythm/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Rhythm"},{"content":"The site uses topics to hold onto specific keywords, thus narrowing down the subject or keeping it open for discussion.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://jenro.fun/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics"},{"content":" Some relevant links/affiliates.

This time, I\u0026rsquo;m releasing one simfile for the month!\nPerfect World - Conro, Marlhy # Mediafire This chart and song encapsulates being aware of the world around you, and how, perhaps your decisions were part of the effects that made it the imperfect world that it is. The flipside to that is, it\u0026rsquo;s a fun song! That stream of banjo makes it feel like a wild cowboy ride, which heroically lead me to make a chart for it.\nAlso, next month will be time for FearMIX, so I\u0026rsquo;m anticipating the spooks that will bring.\n","date":"September 22, 2025","permalink":"https://jenro.fun/posts/jenros-arrows-september-2025-release/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Jenro's Arrows September 2025 Release"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://jenro.fun/topics/simfiles/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Simfiles"},{"content":"These two new simfile releases draw from an inner war with the \u0026ldquo;beta\u0026rdquo; state.\nAlone - Maduk, Marianna Ray # Mediafire Our Story - Vicktor, Strybo # Mediafire Revising previously released files has been the initial goal, but the current technology does not allow for automatic updates yet, and I\u0026rsquo;ll have to analyze further where my releases are considerably better off.\nIn the meantime, these done-deal, one-off downloads are now available for download!
