## Mind The Times

Welcome! Enjoy your visit. What is '*Mind The Times*'?

Throughout the years, I've been in a search towards my true voice. I couldn't truly share what I found yet fully, so it became an ongoing thing, sharing bits of my personal search with the internet.

What 'Mind The Times' is, currently, is a wish to be open about the times.

I'm currently moving through a spectrum of interests, with the main ones being the following.

### My cinema discovery

A lot of my cinema watching experience is locked into my [Letterboxd account](https://letterboxd.com/throughline7/) and that's been a mix of both wild and precise, to say the least. Some of this experience might have caused me to stray far from my own voice, so it's a process that needs major changes as it stands.

### My arrows

With my current understanding of the charts I make for the rhythm game [Stepmania](https://www.stepmania.com/), I get a lot more emotionally motivated by the charting process and the song selection, and I have a more solid grasp with that emotion compared to when I first started. 

This way of charting might be entirely detached from the game's nature itself, and the method I've adhered to is to keep the arrows as close to me as possible, in order to know exactly what changed with time, so I can revise it readily.

### My graphic design portfolio

I previously worked as a full-time graphic designer. I still know how to design, but having the least amount of practice now means I don't keep up with the industry as much as I should. This could still change, it's still just as interesting to me, that is, *if* I could separate the drama from, well, actual work.
