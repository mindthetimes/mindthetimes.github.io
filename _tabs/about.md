## Jenro's Blog

Jenro's Blog is a culmination and launchpad for Jenro's interests. In a sea of heavy noise that is the internet, this website hopes to be a space that emphasizes ownership of content, and generally just moving away from traditional options of where content lies.

Being mostly a personal website, I put some effort into getting myself out there and fitting in with the web. Seeing the changes in technology, I am trying to get to it and understand that the popular way of doing things is not always the correct way.

I am keen on my observations that there is a problem with my understanding of the web, and that the vibrance and interest in the web was not as it was in my younger years. A revitalization may be amply needed on my part. But by sharing my stories and blog posts in part with you, I believe that I am able to create something of utmost value. It all seems rudimentary at the moment, but it is part of our coexistence with the modern world.

## Jenro's Story

Beginning as a character from a written story based off classmates in school, and evolving into a player-made tactician for the Fire Emblem series and then leading a group of newbies stand against pub-stomping in Defense of the Ancients, Jenro has become more than just a character but an outlook towards life. More than a persona, Jenro embodies not just being an extension of the self, but a movement towards ones' deeply held values.
